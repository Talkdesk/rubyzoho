Abstracting Zoho's API into a set of Ruby classes, with reflection of Zoho's fields using a more familiar
ActiveRecord lifecycle, but without ActiveRecord. Current focus is on Zoho CRM.

<b>WARNING: Edge is currently untested. Out of API calls. </b>

<b>Release notes are at the \end of this page.</b>

== Install
    gem install rubyzoho

== Configure

=== Rails
Put the following in an initializer (e.g. <tt><RAILS_ROOT>/config/initializers/zoho.rb</tt>):

    require 'ruby_zoho'

    RubyZoho.configure do |config|
      config.api_key = '<< API Key from Zoho>>'
      # config.crm_modules = ['Accounts', 'Contacts', 'Leads', 'Potentials'] # Defaults to free edition if not set
      # config.crm_modules = ['Quotes', 'SalesOrders', 'Invoices'] # Depending on what kind of account you've got, adds to free edition modules
      # config.ignore_fields_with_bad_names = true # Ignores field with special characters in the name (Release 1.8)
      # Currently only Quotes are supported
    end

=== Ruby
Make sure the following block is executed prior to making calls to the gem.

    require 'ruby_zoho'

    RubyZoho.configure do |config|
      config.api_key = '<< API Key from Zoho>>'
      # config.crm_modules = ['Accounts', 'Contacts', 'Leads', 'Potentials'] # Defaults to free edition if not set
      # config.crm_modules = ['Quotes', 'SalesOrders', 'Invoices'] # Depending on what kind of account you've got, adds to free edition modules
      # config.ignore_fields_with_bad_names = true # Ignores field with special characters in the name (Release 1.8)
      # Currently only Quotes are suported
    end

Please be aware that Zoho limits API calls. So running tests repeatedly will quickly exhaust
your daily allowance. See below for some optimizations during development and testing.



== Use
RubyZoho attempts to follow the ActiveRecord lifecycle, i.e. new, save, update and delete.
See examples below. (<b>N.B. Fields _cannot_ have special characters in them.</b>)

To get a list of supported attributes for a Zoho CRM contact:

    require 'ruby_zoho'

    c = RubyZoho::Crm::Contact.new
    c.attr_writers  # => List of updatable attributes
    c.fields # => Array of all fields

Attributes are reflected from the current API instance of Zoho, dynamically on
initialization of the API, when the RubyZoho.configure block is called. This
includes custom fields.

Another example:

    l = RubyZoho::Crm::Lead.new
    l.attr_writers  # => List of updatable attributes
    l.fields # => Array of all fields

To retrieve an existing record:

    l = RubyZoho::Crm::Lead.find_by_email('email@domain.com')

Returns one or more records matching the query. The find_by_<attribute> follows
ActiveRecord style reflections, so if the attribute is present in the API, it can
be queried. There is currently a single attribute limitation imposed by the Zoho 
API. Note, what is returned is an Array class which is also Enumerable. Use +.each+,
+.map+, +.first+, +.last+, etc to navigate through the result set.

Equality is the only match currently supported.

To get a list of all accounts:

    a = RubyZoho::Crm::Account.all
    a.each do |account|
      pp account.account_name
    end

Or for all task subjects:

    t = RubyZoho::Crm::Task.all
    pp t.collect { |task| task.subject }  # => ['Subject 1'], ['Subject 2'], ... ['Subject n']

Or for all quotes:

    q = RubyZoho::Crm::Quote.all
    q.each do |quote|
      pp quote.subject
      pp quote.quote_name
    end

To get the first quote:
    q.first

Or the last one:
    q.last

Since the result is Enumerable:
    q.map { |m| m.last_name }
works.

To sort a result set:
    r = RubyZoho::Crm::Contact.all
    sorted =  r.sort {|a, b| a.last_name <=> b.last_name }
    pp sorted.collect { |c| c.last_name }  # => ['Name 1', ['Name 2'], ... ['Name n']]

To find by ID, note well, ID is a *string*:
    leads = RubyZoho::Crm::Lead.all
    l = RubyZoho::Crm::Lead.find_by_leadid(leads.last.leadid)

To create a new record:

    c = RubyZoho::Crm::Contact.new(
      :first_name => 'First Name',
      :last_name => 'Last Name',
      :email => 'email@domain.com',
      etc.
    )
    c.save
    r = RubyZoho::Crm::Contact.find_by_email('email@domain.com')
    r.first.contactid # => Has the newly created contact's ID


To add a contact to an existing account:

    a = RubyZoho::Crm::Account.find_by_account_name('Very Big Account')
    c = RubyZoho::Crm::Contact.new(
      :first_name => 'First Name',
      :last_name => 'Last Name',
      :email => 'email@domain.com',
      :account_name => a.first.account_name,
      :accountid => a.first.accountid  # accountid instead of account_id because of Zoho's convention
      etc.
    )
    c.save

To update a record (<b>Note, that the attribute is :id</b>):
    l = RubyZoho::Crm::Lead.find_by_email('email@domain.com')
    RubyZoho::Crm::Lead.update(
        :id => l.first.leadid,
        :email => 'changed_email@domain.com'
    )

Custom fields are like any other field or method in Ruby:
    a = RubyZoho::Crm::Account.find_by_account_name('Very Big Account')
    pp a.custom_field # => 'Custom field content'

Or:
    c = RubyZoho::Crm::Contact.new(
      :first_name => 'First Name',
      :last_name => 'Last Name',
      :email => 'email@domain.com',
      :account_name => a.first.account_name,
      :accountid => a.first.accountid,  # accountid instead of account_id because of Zoho's convention
      :custom_field_2 => 'Custom text'
    )
    pp c.save   # Reflects back the new Zoho record ID, and various create and modify times and users

To attach a file to a record (Tested for +Accounts+, +Contacts+, +Leads+, +Potentials+ and +Tasks+ only):
    l = RubyZoho::Crm::Lead.find_by_email('email@domain.com')
    l.attach_file(file_path, file_name)     # Can only be attached to a pre-existing record

Classes (Zoho modules) currently supported are:
    RubyZoho::Crm::Account
    RubyZoho::Crm::Contact
    RubyZoho::Crm::Lead
    RubyZoho::Crm::Potential
    RubyZoho::Crm::Task
    RubyZoho::Crm::Quote
    RubyZoho::Crm::User

== Error Handling
Errors, i.e. situations where the Zoho API either returns an http code something other than 200
or where the Zoho API sends back an explicit error code which <b>isn't</b> in the set

    ['4422', '5000']

a standard Ruby +RuntimeError+ exception is raised with the Zoho's API message.

== Optimizations for Development and Testing
Set <tt>config.cache_fields = true</tt> in the configuration block. This caches \module field
lists and is useful during development and testing, to reduce total API calls during start up.
Defaults to false. We <b>do not</b> recommend use of this in production. The gem will need
write access to its own directory for this to work.

    RubyZoho.configure do |config|
      # Other stuff for initialization
      config.cache_fields = true
    end

== Idiosyncractic Behavior
    From freedictionary.com
    id·i·o·syn·cra·sy ( d - -s ng kr -s ). n. pl. id·i·o·syn·cra·sies.
    1. A structural or behavioral characteristic peculiar to an individual or group.


The Zoho API is definitely opinionated. And we have yet to be able plumb the depths of its
views. If it behaves unexpectedly, try the Zoho forums before opening an issue here. It
just may be the way the API works...

An example of this is retrieving related records. You would think that since a Task can
be related to an Account or a Potential etc. that you should be able to retrieve it by
either the related \module's record id, which is stored with the Task. But no, can't be done.

== Bugs and Enhancements
Please open an issue on GitHub. Or better yet, send in a pull request with the fix or enhancement!

=== Known Bugs or Issues
1. If you're having trouble with updating custom fields, be sure to check the permission of the user that created the custom field.

=== Roadmap (Ranked)
1. AR style master/detail updates e.g. where +a+ is an account.
    a << RubyZoho::Crm::Contact.new(
        :last_name => 'Last Name',
        :first_name => 'First Name'
    )
2. Get related records using AR style syntax, e.g.
        pp a.contacts
   to get contacts associated with an account.
3. Support for multiple find fields.

== Contributing to rubyzoho
* Pull requests with unit tests or specs and a version branch are welcomed.
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
